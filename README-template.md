## My process

I built the html skeleton first. Adding all the elements needed. Once all the needed information was built, I headed over to the CSS to properly stylize the elements. Then I added the javascript functionality of the buttons.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Native Javascript


### What I learned

I learned a lot about how javascript interacts with css in this project. Figuring out how to change what was displayed without putting the results in a new html file was tricky. The solution I implemented was not something I thought native javascript could do so easliy. I learned a bunch of new ways to implement CSS that I did not know before.

### Continued development

Continuing to work on this project, I will be further tweaking the CSS. It is not in a place that I feel like it is fully finished.
